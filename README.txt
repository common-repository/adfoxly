== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How to install? =

You have two options.
First: Just download ZIP file from the top, and put it in Plugins section in your WordPress.
Second: Go to the your WordPress Website Admin Panel. Click on "Plugins" on the right and "Add new" on the top in next step. On the top right search type: "adfoxly". After that click on the button "Install now" and wait few seconds. After all, click "Activate". That's all.

= Do you put own ads on my website which could be seen by my visitors? =

No! Of course not! We do not put any ads displayed to your visitors. We have standards.

= How to start with AdFoxly? =

Start with adding a new ad. You don’t have to configure a campaign or a place. First, upload a banner or a Google AdSense code. Then choose a place to show the ad. Simple as that.

= Ad - what is it? =

An ad is a banner, Google AdSense ad, or a custom HTML ad

= Campaign - what is it? =

The Campaign is a set of options to group your ads. The Campaign lets you configure max ad views or clicks, also start and end dates. PRO version enables you to limit the Campaign to defined countries or set specific weekdays and time of the day. Also, you can set max views for one user per ad.

= Campaign - do I need to use it? =

No. It’s just a way to group a few banners into some project. You can use campaigns while working with your advertisement partners.

= Place - what is it? =

Place lets you configure ads behavior for different places of your ads (such as Before or After Post). You set places to rotate ads: on a page refresh or after some time without refreshing a page (e.g. 10 seconds).

= Places - do I need to configure them? =

No. You can use places without configuring them. While configuring a new ad, simply choose a place or places in which you want your ads to be displayed.

= AdSense - how to earn money? =

You need to sign up for an AdSense account. Once you configure it, you can paste your code to a new ad in AdFoxly.

= AdSense Ad displays in wrong place? =

Check how generate AdSense code properly. First you need to remember to DO NOT choose a "Auto Ads", but create a own Ad Unit. Look at the image above in FAQ.
